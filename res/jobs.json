Despite the high potential of HRAS systems, current full-scale HRAS implementation struggle with operational problems.

They 'detect' the region of singularity formation and adapt themselves in order not to lose precision. The task for interested student will be implementation of moving mesh method for such PDEs under supervisor guidance. The idea is to make the numerical lattice 'movable' in such a way that it gathers around the points at which higher accuracy is needed.<br>Next, it is vital to improve efficiency of such software therefore it will be required to write the code in Pyhton, C/C++ or in mixed approach. Final task is to make the code parallel using OpenMP or/and MPI popular in High Performance Computing and test it on supercomputer. The final result will be the library for moving mesh methods for evolutionary PDEs.",
